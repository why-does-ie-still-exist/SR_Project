# Special Relativity Project

This project shows (maybe) what an object would look like if it passed near you or a camera at near-relativistic speeds. Check out the notebook in the `src` directory

This project was inspired by:
- My Phys 103 Class
- [Terrell Rotation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation)
- [Length contraction: the real explanation by Fermilab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Poz_95_0RA)
- [The visualizations in this video on the Terrell Rotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTY74hYdG4s)
- [This awesome video on the optical effects of SR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQnHTKZBTI4)
